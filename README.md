# WebScraper-by-Fabrizio
This is a Web Scraper that can get you a wide range of files formats from pretty much any website. Highly customizable.
Just run the code in Python. 
Just add the URL. The depth of the scrap. The folder and the formats you want. Then wait. You can see the process in a log displayed in the window. A message will appear when it finishes. 

Built using Beautiful Soap, Requests and Tkinter.
